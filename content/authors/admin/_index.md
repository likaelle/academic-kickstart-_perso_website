I am is a researcher and lecturer in Cognitive Neuroscience. 
Currently, I am working as a lecturer at DIS Study Abroad, a non profit institution receiving american undergraduate students to study for a semester in Stockholm. Within DIS https://disabroad.org/stockholm/ , I currently teach 3 classes: the Affective Neuroscience class, the associated Affective Neuroscience lab, and the Developing Brain. 
For my research, I am affiliated to KIND (Karolinska Institutet center for Neurodevelopmental Disorders  https://ki.se/en/kind/center-of-neurodevelopmental-disorders-at-karolinska-institutet-kind ) where I study mostly the neuroanatomy of Autism Spectrum Disorder, with a specific focus on biological sex differences, as well as the early neuroanatomical development of ASD. 


Specifically, within the RATSS (Roots of Autism and ADHDH Twin Study Sweden) project, I have been working on 8 to 25-year-old twins who are either discordant or concordant for autism, or typically developing twins. I have been participating in the MRI scanning of the participating twins, analyzing obtained anatomical brain images and publishing 3 papers on sex differences on the neurophenotype of ASD.
A second project I have been conducted, studies babies at risk of autism (i.e. who have at least one autistic sibling) within the EU-AIMS framework https://www.eu-aims.eu/. I have been collecting eye-tracking data, cerebral electric activity (EEG) and Magnetic Resonance Images in 5-month-olds.

The goal of my current research: finding neurobiomarkers of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Since it is unlikely to find one marker for such a heterogeneous disorder, our approach is to characterize deeply our participants in order to stratify them. Specific deficits linked to ASD might correspond to specific anatomical cerebral differences. From these differences, the ultimate goal is to provide individually tailored help or treatment.

Before moving to Sweden for my postdoc, I completed my phD in June 2012 under the supervision of [Christophe Pallier](http://www.pallier.org) in the [Cognitive Neuroimaging Unit](http://www.unicog.org/) in Neurospin, near Paris, France. Then, I worked as a postdoc on the neuroanatomy of dyslexia in the [Cognitive Sciences and Psycholinguistic Lab](http://www.lscp.net/) at the ENS in Paris, in [Franck Ramus](http://www.lscp.net/persons/ramus/en/index.html)â€˜ team. My scientific interests are widespread. For instance during my phD, I focused on Language and Music domains inquiring the following questions:

* How and when do toddlers acquire/use syntactic knowledge?
* How do syntactic and prosodic knowledge constrain possible meaning for unknown words?
* How do they constrain lexical access?
* What is the neural substrate for syntactic structure processing?
* Are neural networks implicated in linguistic hierarchical structure building also recruited by other domains such as music?
* Does musical expertise influence perception and neural processing of musical hierarchical structures?



%From 2013 to 2019, I have been responsible for the Neuroimaging section at KIND.
